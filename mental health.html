Talk to your <mark>department</mark>, check the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/ssid/contacts/advice"><b>Student Advice Centre's website</b></a> or seek help from<a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/ssd/ssg/cwag"><b> Central Welfare and Guidance</b></a> (CWaG). You can be sure that the difficulties you're experiencing now can be dealt with professionally, you don't have to cope with them alone.

  			<h1>Professional support</h1>
  			<p class="text-justify">
  				Sometimes, problems are harder to solve and require professional assistance. There is an unrightful stigma around mental health problems, so you shouldn't feel pressured to power through or wait to hit the bottleneck. There are <mark>confidential</mark> services at Uni, such as the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/ssid/counselling"><b>University Counselling Service</b></a> and the <a href-"http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/health"><b>University Health Service</b></a> (UHS). Also, many students struggle with their courses without realising they may have <mark>dyslexia</mark>, so the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/ssid/disability"><b>Disability and Dyslexia Support Service</b></a> can help with diagnoses, adjustments and advice for different conditions that you may have.
